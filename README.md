## My story:
When I was little, I loved playing with legos. A year later, I started fantasizing about starting my own Lego store. Another year later, I began to feel like I was good with computers. I helped my teachers solve problems and eventually, I got into programming. My first program was a "Hello World" script I had written. That's when I knew this was just the beginning. When I was 14 years old I started learning C# and developing games in Unity. But that hype, unfortunately, died down a bit and I saw more potential in crypto and bot development. That's how I got into the company: Emrit. Emrit taught me how to work with a team, I was able to bring out my programming skills, I learned how to work under pressure and all that at my own pace. I know I've only just started and entrepreneurship is clearly in my blood. I'm happy for all the opportunities I get at this age and I hope there are many more adventures to come.
